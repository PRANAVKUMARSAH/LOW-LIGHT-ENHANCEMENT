# LOW-LIGHT-ENHANCEMENT
low-light image enhancement does not require any normal-light image in training, thereby freeing from the chains of paired or unpaired training data that are time-consuming to obtain. However, existing methods suffer color deviation and fail to generalize to various lighting conditions. method based on Retinex only integrates Retinex theory
